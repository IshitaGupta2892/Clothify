# Clothify - Vanilla JS E-commerce

Static multi-page e-commerce demo built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Uses localStorage for cart and static JSON for products.

## Develop
Serve locally with any static server (recommended due to fetch of partials and JSON):

- VSCode Live Server
- `npx serve` or `python -m http.server`

Open http://localhost:PORT/index.html

## Structure
See folders under `/assets`, `/partials`, and `/data`.

## Deploy
Host as static site (Netlify, GitHub Pages). Ensure paths from root `/` or adjust to relative paths.
